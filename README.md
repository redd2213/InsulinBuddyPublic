# InsulinBuddy Scripts

**Disclaimer:**  
This repository contains code developed as part of a university project. It is not intended for clinical or medical use.
The insulin dose calculations and related features are approximations and should not be used to make health-related decisions.

## About

This repository includes the core C# scripts from **InsulinBuddy**, a Unity-based mobile application developed for a university project.
This project was initially structured with the help of ChatGPT, and then further adapted and customized to fit the specific requirements of the application.
The app was designed to support diabetic users with:

- Customizable alert systems for medication and glucose tracking
- A basic insulin dose estimation feature
- A history component for saving stats and logs
- Notification logic for user reminders

The full application was completed in March 2025 as part of the **Scientific and Professional Writing and Communication** course.

## Note

Only the scripts are provided here. Assets, UI elements, and Unity scenes are excluded from this repository.
